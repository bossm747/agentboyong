## Overview

This is a comprehensive AI Runtime Sandbox that now hosts **Pareng Boyong** - a Filipino AI AGI Super Agent developed by InnovateHub PH. The system provides a secure, isolated execution environment where Pareng Boyong runs with full capabilities as a true super agent. Pareng Boyong has complete freedom within the runtime sandbox while maintaining host system security. The architecture combines our runtime sandbox infrastructure with culturally-aware Filipino AI capabilities, creating an unlimited potential AI assistant that understands both English and Filipino contexts.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Real-time Communication**: Native WebSocket API for live updates

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Real-time**: WebSocket server for live collaboration
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling file uploads
- **Process Management**: Node.js child_process and node-pty for terminal emulation

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless driver
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage with fallback to database persistence
- **File System**: Local file system with workspace isolation per session

## Key Components

### Pareng Boyong - Filipino AGI Interface
- **Primary User Interface**: Pareng Boyong runs as the main Filipino AI AGI super agent interface
- **Cultural Awareness**: Built with Filipino culture, language, and business context understanding
- **Complete Freedom**: Full execution capabilities within secure runtime sandbox
- **Docker Replacement**: Eliminated Docker Desktop dependency, using runtime sandbox instead
- **Unlimited Potential**: No artificial restrictions on Pareng Boyong's capabilities
- **Persistent Memory**: Database-backed long-term memory across sessions
- **Bilingual Support**: Fluent in both English and Filipino languages

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server
- **Standardized AI Integration**: Implements MCP specification for tool-based AI interactions
- **10 Core Tools**: Session management, file operations, code execution, package installation, project templates
- **Language Support**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, Bash
- **Agent Zero Integration**: Provides backend services for Agent Zero's operations

### Session Management
Each session is isolated with its own workspace directory and associated services. Sessions support both web UI and MCP tool access with consistent state management.

### File System Service
- Workspace isolation per session under `./workspace/{sessionId}`
- File CRUD operations with MIME type detection
- Directory tree structure management
- MCP tool integration for programmatic access

### Terminal Service
- Cross-platform command execution without native dependencies
- Support for multiple programming language runtimes
- Real-time execution through WebSockets and MCP tools
- Process tracking and management

### Mobile-Responsive Web Interface
- **Collapsible Containers**: File explorer and system monitor slide-out panels
- **Touch-Optimized**: Mobile-first design with gesture support
- **Adaptive Layout**: Responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable with offline capabilities

### Code Editor
- Monaco Editor integration with syntax highlighting
- Multi-language support with automatic language detection
- Real-time file saving with optimistic updates
- Mobile-optimized interface

### System Monitoring
- Real-time CPU, memory, and disk usage tracking
- Process monitoring and management
- Environment variable management
- WebSocket and MCP tool access

## Data Flow

1. **Session Creation**: User connects → Creates session → Initializes workspace and services
2. **File Operations**: File actions → FileSystemService → Local filesystem → Database sync
3. **Code Editing**: Editor changes → Debounced save → API call → File update
4. **Terminal Operations**: User input → WebSocket → TerminalService → PTY → Output back through WebSocket
5. **System Updates**: Periodic monitoring → SystemMonitorService → WebSocket broadcast → UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL serverless connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **node-pty**: Terminal emulation
- **ws**: WebSocket server implementation
- **multer**: File upload handling

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI component primitives
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant management
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Vite dev server with HMR for frontend
- tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- Concurrent frontend and backend development

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized static assets
- esbuild bundles server code for Node.js
- Environment-based configuration switching

### Database
- Drizzle migrations for schema management
- Environment variable configuration for database URL
- PostgreSQL dialect with connection pooling
